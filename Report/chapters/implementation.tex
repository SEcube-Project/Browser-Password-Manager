\chapter{Implementation Details}
This is where you explain what you have implemented and how you have implemented it. Place here all the details that you consider important, organize the chapter in sections and subsections to explain the development and your workflow.\\Given the self-explicative title of the chapter, readers usually skip it. This is ok, because this entire chapter is simply meant to describe the details of your work so that people that are very interested (such as people who have to evaluate your work or people who have to build something more complex starting from what you did) can fully understand what you developed or implemented.\\Don't worry about placing too many details in this chapter, the only essential thing is that you keep everything tidy, without mixing too much information (so make use of sections, subsections, lists, etc.). As usual, pictures are helpful.
