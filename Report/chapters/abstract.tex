\chapter*{Abstract}

It is widely known that passwords are becoming more and more important, since every day people are using them to protect their data. There are several ways to store your passwords, such as writing them on a piece of paper or in a file (both in the smartphone or in the laptop). Another method is to remember by hearth the passwords, but this is not feasible since there would be too many pieces of information to remember. In this context, password managers, such as Bitwarden, LastPass, or Keepass, are good solutions. However, if not self-hosted, all these password managers store the passwords in a cloud, which means that they are not completely under the user control. 

These were the main reasons behind the creation of this project, whose goal is to help people to remember their passwords, and to make it easier for them to access their data. In addition to that, data are stored on a board, which is secure by definition thanks to the technology used. Moreover it is needed to have access to the physical board in order to manage the data. 

The password manager has been designed from the ground up to be secure, but it also has a user-friendly Chrome extension that simplifies the insertion of the passwords in various websites.
