\chapter{Results}
In this chapter we expect you to list and explain all the results that you have achieved. Pictures can be useful to explain the results. Think about this chapter as something similar to the demo of the oral presentation. You can also include pictures about use-cases (you can also decide to add use cases to the high level overview chapter).
\section{Known Issues}
If there is any known issue, limitation, error, problem, etc...explain it in this section. Use a specific subsection for each known issue. Issues can be related to many things, including design issues.
\section{Future Work}
Adding a section about how to improve the project is not mandatory but it is useful to show that you actually understood the topics of the project and have ideas for improvements.
