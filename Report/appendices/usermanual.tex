\chapter{User Manual}
\label{usermanual}
In the user manual you should explain, step-by-step, how to reproduce the demo that you showed in the oral presentation or the results you mentioned in the previous chapters.\\ If it is necessary to install some toolchain that is already well described in the original documentation (i.e., Espressif's toolchain for ESP32 boards or the SEcube toolchain) just insert a reference to the original documentation (and remember to clearly specify which version of the original documentation must be used). There is no need to copy and paste step-by-step guides that are already well-written and available.\\The user manual must explain how to re-create what you did in the project, no matter if it is low-level code (i..e VHDL on SEcube's FPGA), high-level code (i.e., a GUI) or something more heterogeneous (i.e. a bunch of ESP32 or Raspberry Pi communicating among them and interacting with other devices).
